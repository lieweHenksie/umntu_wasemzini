## Glorious Purpose

To whom it may concern,

People think it's hard to make a difference. 

but it's not

Every one of our decisions, actions, and purchases 

**echoes** 

acrross our nearly 8 billion strong existence. 
 
 Every bit of plastic,
 
 every ounce of kindness,
  
 all of it _stretches_ across us all. 

And although making a difference isn't hard,

 making the right one is. 

 For now we are still a hedonistic little superbaby testing it's morality. A single organism in its infancy, just barely able to to communicate with itself. 


We are obscured from ourselves, 



But many of our truths exist already, in a foreign metafor, or a funeral rite, or an elder's smile.

Just as all people must know themselves, eventually, we will know each other.  

My silly ambition and glorious purpose is trivial. 

An ambassador, 
a go betweens from people to person. 


Kindest Regards
